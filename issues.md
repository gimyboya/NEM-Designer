Here is a list of what pushes me to create a new paper-wallet generator

1. my password was longer than what the input accept (basically I couldn't use the old generator at all)
2. no option to choose types of wallets
3. I wanted to create something customizable.
4. I wanted a cross platform app
5. Able to choose different types of accounts.
