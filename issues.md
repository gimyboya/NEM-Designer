Here is a list of what pushes me to create a new paper-wallet generator

1. my password was longer than what the input accept (basically I couldn't use the old generator at all)
2. no option to choose types of wallets
3. I wanted to create something highly customizable.
4. I wanted a cross platform hence electron app
5. make something that can be integrated in the NanoWallet in the future
